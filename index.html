				<p>I am a CSE Master's student at the University of Michigan interested in programming languages, verification, and human-computer interaction. 
				I contribute to the Hazel project lead by Professor 

				<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/">Cyrus Omar</a>.

				I designed a syntax checker to ensure that student implementations satisfy certain syntax properties such as tail recursiveness. 
				I am currently working on a property-based testing system for Hazel.</p>

				Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Florida.
