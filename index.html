        <p> I am a first year PhD student in the ECE department of Purdue University.
        I am fortunate to be advised by Professor 

        <a href="https://jennalwise.github.io/">Jenna (Wise) DiVincenzo</a>. </p>
        
        <p>I am currently doing research on gradual verification and its educational impact.</p>

				<p>Previously, I was a CSE Master's student at the University of Michigan where I
        contributed to the

				<a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a>

				programming environment led by Professor 

				<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/">Cyrus Omar</a>.</p>

				<p>
				Before that, I studied computer science and mathematics at the University of Florida.
