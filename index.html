				<p>I am a CSE Master's student at the University of Michigan interested in research on programming languages. 
				I contribute to the 

				<a href="https://hazel.org/">Hazel</a>

				programming environment lead by Professor 

				<a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~comar/">Cyrus Omar</a>.</p>

				<p> I designed a syntax checker to ensure that EECS 490 student implementations satisfy certain syntax properties such as whether a function is tail-recursive. 
				I am currently developing a property-based testing system for Hazel.</p> 
				
				<p>
				Previously, I studied Computer Science and Mathematics at the University of Florida.
